# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the long-term vision and future development goals for the Rust Multi-Agent Framework.

## Core Framework Enhancements

-   **Advanced Agent Types:**
    -   **Memory Agent:** Implement an agent with the ability to store and retrieve information from a long-term memory store (e.g., a vector database).
    -   **Research Agent:** Create an agent that can autonomously browse the web, follow links, and gather information to answer complex questions.
-   **Inter-Agent Communication:** Develop a more sophisticated communication protocol between agents, allowing for more complex collaboration and negotiation.
-   **Dynamic Tool Creation:** Give agents the ability to create their own tools on the fly, such as generating and compiling code to solve a specific problem.

## Toolset Expansion

-   **Database Integration:** Add tools for interacting with SQL and NoSQL databases.
-   **API Integration:** Create a generic tool for interacting with REST APIs, allowing the agent to connect to a wide range of external services.
-   **Code Analysis Tools:** Add tools for static and dynamic code analysis, enabling the agent to understand and improve existing codebases.

## Planning and Execution Improvements

-   **Recursive Planning:** Implement a more advanced planning agent that can break down tasks into sub-tasks and create nested plans.
-   **Plan Validation and Refinement:** Give the orchestrator the ability to validate the planner's output and ask for clarification or refinement if a step is unclear or risky.
-   **Error Handling and Recovery:** Improve the executor's ability to handle errors and recover from failed steps, making the system more robust.

## Testing and Evaluation

-   **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Develop a full suite of unit and integration tests to ensure the framework is reliable and bug-free.
-   **Agent Evaluation Framework:** Create a framework for evaluating agent performance on a set of benchmark tasks, allowing for objective measurement of improvements.
